# Book - MiniGames

Game Engine: Unity.

These files belong to an analog-digital book project. Basically a app is in development to increase the book user's experience with some games and here are the source code of they. I hope this can help you in some way.

------- IMPORTANT -------

Inside the "Games" folder, only "Cortesia (minigames)" have files. The older folders inside "Games" are empty.
